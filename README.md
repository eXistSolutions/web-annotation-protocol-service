# Web Annotation Service

aims to be an implementation of [Web Annotation Protocol](http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/protocol/wd/) running as
a service app on eXist-db.

## Approach

Implementing the full spec is a huge effort as always with W3C specs. We'll drive the development
incrementally using our concrete requirements to steer priorities.

Beyond that the effort will target the feature marked as MUST und just eventually consider SHOULD or SHALL features.
